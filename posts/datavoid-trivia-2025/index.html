<blockquote>
<p><em>From a casual CN Lab day to a full-on TechFest triumph — here’s how it all unfolded.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h2>
<p>As I write this, I’m stepping into my 7th semester of engineering. But this story takes me back to 6th sem—the sem that gave me not just classes and labs, but a whole different kind of lesson. A real, raw, hands-on, everything-from-scratch experience of organizing my very first technical event. And this wasn’t some internal class activity or a mini club game. This was <strong>DataVoid Trivia 2025</strong>, conducted as part of VJCET Tech Fest, <strong>Bodhi 2025</strong>, a proper, public-facing event with real stakes, a real crowd, and real chaos.</p>
<p>Our college hosts a national-level Tech and Art every even semester. Until then, I was just a casual participant—walked around, played a few games, maybe clicked some photos, had fun, and went back. Nothing more. But this time&hellip; this time, I ended up on the other side of the table. I was one of the people running it.</p>
<p>And this big shift started in the most unexpected way, during what we thought would be a boring CN lab.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-started">How It All Started</h2>
<p>It was a regular CN Lab session. On most days, we’d be focused on our program sheets — compiling, debugging, submitting. But that particular day felt different. The TechFest was just a week away, so some students were off preparing for their events. The lab wasn’t full, the atmosphere was pretty relaxed, and we were just… chilling. Talking, laughing, running a few programs here and there. A rare calm before the storm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Arsha Ma’am called out for <strong>Elwin</strong>. Out of the blue.</p>
<p>Elwin got up, spoke to her for a bit, and then called <strong>Aabel</strong>. Aabel went over, then turned around and called me.</p>
<p>Now all three of us — close friends — were standing there, slightly confused.</p>
<p>Ma’am smiled and said something along the lines of, <em>“There’s an opportunity for you guys to coordinate an event under CSI for this year’s TechFest. Are you interested?”</em></p>
<p>We had absolutely zero prior experience. Zero clue what “coordinating an event” even fully meant. But without hesitation, we just looked at each other and said, <em>“Yes.”</em></p>
<p>That’s it. Just like that, we were in.</p>
<h2 id="the-brainstorm-phase">The Brainstorm Phase</h2>
<p>As soon as we got back to our seats, we couldn’t sit still. This wasn’t just some side thing anymore — it was <em>our</em> event.</p>
<p>We rotated the chairs and formed a tight circle in the lab. That circle, that moment — that was the real beginning.</p>
<p>Ideas started flying:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>technical treasure hunt</strong>? Rejected. Too complicated to pull off logistically.</li>
<li>A <strong>workshop or class</strong>? Nah. Wouldn’t attract enough people.</li>
<li>A <strong>quiz</strong>? That felt right. We knew it could be fun, flexible, and draw a big crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s how the core format got locked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A two-round quiz — starting with general questions, followed by a round that blends general and technical trivia.</p></blockquote>
<p>We wanted it to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast and fun</li>
<li>Not too brain-draining</li>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Certificate-worthy</li>
</ul>
<p>When we presented it to Arsha Ma’am, she gave a green signal and mentioned a target of <strong>50 teams</strong>. That number wasn’t random — it matched the <strong>₹5000 prize pool</strong> we planned to offer. She made one thing clear: if we couldn’t reach 50 teams, <strong>CSI would cover the prize fund</strong>. But if we did reach the target, we’d be completely self-sustaining — maybe even make a little surplus for ourselves.</p>
<p>The goal was set. The mission had begun.</p>
<h2 id="designing-the-event">Designing the Event</h2>
<p>We first called it <strong>Trivia 2025</strong>. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>But then we partnered with <strong>Jace Joji</strong>, a senior who was a part of the <strong>DataVoid</strong> team — a quiz platform developed by a talented crew. Jace offered to host our event on their platform and even suggested an extra certificate for participants from the DataVoid side.</p>
<p>So the event name evolved into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DataVoid Trivia 2025</strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="date">Date</h3>
<p>12th February 2025 — Day 2 of TechFest</p>
<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>
<p>Common Computing Center (CCC) — ~60 seats</p>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<ul>
<li>Teams of 2</li>
<li>Entry Fee: ₹100/team (₹50 per person)</li>
<li>Round 1: General questions (screen-based)</li>
<li>Round 2: General + Technical mix (top teams qualify)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
<p>DataVoid — online quiz system (laptops + mobile support)</p>
<h3 id="benefits-to-participants">Benefits to Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li>Certificate from TechFest</li>
<li>Certificate from DataVoid team</li>
<li>Juice refreshment</li>
<li>Low time investment, high value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prize-pool">Prize Pool</h3>
<ul>
<li>1st Prize: ₹3000</li>
<li>2nd Prize: ₹1500</li>
<li>3rd Prize: ₹500</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-marketing-strategy-who-how-and-why">Our Marketing Strategy: Who, How, and Why</h2>
<p>After designing the event, our next step was to plan the marketing — and we took this seriously.</p>
<p>We analyzed each year group:</p>
<ul>
<li>4th years: Too busy with projects, internships. Would probably skip TechFest. Not ideal.</li>
<li>3rd years: Most of them were coordinators themselves. Schedule clash. Not reliable.</li>
<li>2nd years: Might join. Some interest, depending on how we pitch.</li>
<li>1st years: Perfect. It’s their first TechFest. They’re curious, eager, and hungry for certificates. This was our golden audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>We crafted a full-blown ground-level marketing strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Team Formation: We built a 10-member campaign crew.</li>
<li>Classroom Invasion: Instead of just dropping links, we entered classes in full form.</li>
<li>Bench-by-Bench Talk: Each member took a bench — explained the event, clarified doubts, encouraged participation.</li>
<li>On-the-Spot Registrations: If anyone looked interested, we helped them register then and there.</li>
<li>Follow-Ups: For the unsure ones, we took down names and reached out later.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach — personal, hands-on, and persistent — worked. Especially with the 1st years.</p>
<p>Our pitch was clear:</p>
<p>₹50 per person<br>
2 certificates<br>
Juice<br>
Quick, fun quiz<br>
= Totally worth it.</p>
<h2 id="promotion-troubles-at-first">Promotion Troubles at First</h2>
<p>Our posters, Google Forms, and QR codes were all ready by the weekend before TechFest.</p>
<p>We shared them everywhere — class groups, batch groups, Instagram stories.</p>
<p>But… nothing.</p>
<p>Not a single registration.</p>
<p>We weren’t even allowed to start classroom promotions until the week of TechFest — Monday and Tuesday. So the weekend was just dead silent.</p>
<p>We knew we had a solid event, but without visibility, it meant nothing. The pressure started creeping in.</p>
<h2 id="turning-it-around">Turning It Around</h2>
<p>Monday arrived. The first real chance to canvas.</p>
<p>But — curveball — I had to attend my cousin’s wedding. Aabel was also unavailable.</p>
<p>The rest of the team, though, stepped up and went full force into classes.</p>
<p>While at the church for the Holy Mass, I opened my phone post-prayer and saw the first ₹100 GPay notification.</p>
<p>Our first registration.</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>Soon, another came in. Then another. My phone was buzzing. It was finally happening.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, 20 teams had registered. ₹2000 collected. We finally had traction. We weren’t going down after all.</p>
<p>Tuesday followed with another surge. Our classroom invasion tactic was paying off.</p>
<h2 id="registration-timeline">Registration Timeline</h2>
<p>Here’s how it panned out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday: ~20 teams</li>
<li>Tuesday: +30 more</li>
<li>Wednesday (TechFest Day 1): +25</li>
<li>Thursday morning (Event Day): +12</li>
<li>Spot Registrations: ~Few more</li>
</ul>
<p>We had to book an extra classroom (Room 222) to accommodate the overflow.</p>
<p>Final count: 87 teams<br>
That’s 174 students.</p>
<p>Our tiny quiz dream turned into the biggest event of the entire TechFest. The pride we felt? Unmatched.</p>
<h2 id="event-day-the-madness">Event Day: The Madness</h2>
<p>12th Feb 2025.</p>
<p>The day was here.</p>
<p>We assembled early in front of CCC. Mathew Biji handled the juice refreshment. Jace arrived with full support. He and Aabel helped set up the platform, handle the quiz Excel sheets, and manage GPay reconciliations.</p>
<p>We arranged:</p>
<ul>
<li>A help desk outside CCC: Spot registrations + attendance (Elba &amp; Ann Sunny)</li>
<li>Inside CCC: 2 participants per PC</li>
<li>In Room 222: Mobile-based quiz access (for overflow crowd)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was at the laptop creating the live attendance sheet — all spot and pre-registrations were tracked there.</p>
<p>By 9:30 AM, we planned to close registrations. But they just kept coming. We stretched it till 9:45, then finally called it.</p>
<p>When I opened the CCC door — madness. A full-on crowd. Congested like crazy.</p>
<p>Our plan of checking everyone in right there? Cancelled. Instead, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guided batches to either CCC or Room 222</li>
<li>Took attendance live (Elvi, Jeon &amp; I in class; others in CCC)</li>
<li>Ensured seating and login setup</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 1 began around 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students faced a bug where an image overlapped a question. We called Jace — he said to skip it.</li>
<li>In CCC, Ebin, Aabel, Shaji, Elba, Ann Sunny, Elsa, and others monitored students and ensured smooth flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 10:50, the round ended. Top 15 teams shortlisted.</p>
<p>We handed out juice refreshments.</p>
<h2 id="round-2--final-winners">Round 2 &amp; Final Winners</h2>
<p>By 11:30 AM, teams reassembled at CCC for Round 2.</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rechecked the system</li>
<li>Let students log in again</li>
<li>Walked around ensuring everyone was on track</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 2 wrapped up in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Results were out.</p>
<p>The Top 3 were chosen and awarded their prizes by our Assistant HoD, Andrews Sir.</p>
<p>We clicked group pics with Arsha Ma’am and Andrews Sir — she was visibly happy. Proud.</p>
<p>She even appreciated our ethics and transparency.</p>
<p>We cleaned up, cleared chairs, and tossed out juice packs. Left the place just as we found it.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>At the beginning itself, Arsha Ma’am had told us that anything we made beyond the prize pool was ours to keep.</p>
<p>And yes, we did make a small surplus. To our surprise, Ma’am also handed us some extra money, and with that, our lunch for both TechFest and ArtFest days got covered.</p>
<p>We later came to know — out of the dozens of events that ran during the TechFest, DataVoid Trivia had the highest number of registrations.</p>
<h2 id="looking-back">Looking Back</h2>
<p>Honestly, this was a massive milestone for me. Not because it was “just” an event, but because it was our event. Built from scratch, coordinated by friends, and executed without chaos.</p>
<p>We’re a group of thick friends — we don’t do half-hearted. From flipping chairs in a lab to chasing students with QR codes, we poured our heart into this.</p>
<p>And the reward?</p>
<p>Pride. Growth. Memories.</p>
<p>DataVoid Trivia 2025 — we’ll remember this one for a long, long time.</p>
