<blockquote>
<p>From a casual CN Lab day to a full-on TechFest triumph — here’s how it all unfolded.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I write this, I’m stepping into my 7th semester of engineering. But this story takes me back to 6th sem — the sem that gave me not just classes and labs, but a whole different kind of lesson. A real, raw, hands-on, everything-from-scratch experience of organizing my very first technical event. And this wasn’t some internal class activity or a mini club game. This was <em>DataVoid Trivia 2025</em>, conducted as part of VJCET Tech Fest, <a href="https://vjcet.org/bodhi"><strong>Bodhi 2025</strong></a> — a proper, public-facing event with real stakes, a real crowd, and real chaos.</p>
<p>Our college hosts a national-level Tech Fest and Arts Fest every even semester. Until then, I was just a casual participant — walked around, played a few games, maybe clicked some photos, had fun, and went back. Nothing more. But this time&hellip; this time, I ended up on the other side of the table. I was one of the people running it.</p>
<p>And this big shift started in the most unexpected way — during what we <em>thought</em> would be just another regular CN lab.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-all-started">How It All Started</h2>
<p>So, picture this: It was a Computer Networks lab session—on paper. But Tech Fest was just around the corner, and the campus was buzzing. Half the class was missing because many students were off coordinating events, doing meetings, or just skipping &amp; chilling. The few of us who were there were just chilling, trying out CN programs here and there, casually waiting for the period to end.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, out of nowhere, <em>Arsha Ma’am, our CN teacher and also the faculty-in-charge of **CSI (Computer Society of India)</em>, called out Elwin. He didn’t even expect it. Then Elwin called Aabel, and Aabel called me. One by one, our friend group somehow got pulled into this mysterious mission.</p>
<p>We stood there, half-clueless, and Ma’am told us, <em>“There’s an open slot under CSI to host an event for TechFest. Do you guys want to organize something?”</em></p>
<p>Now, mind you, most of us had ever coordinated anything before. No formal event experience, no idea about handling people or tech or registration or—honestly—anything. But we just looked at each other, smiled, and said, “Yes.” Just like that. With no plan, no clue, no fallback.</p>
<p>And boom, we were officially coordinators.</p>
<h2 id="the-brainstorm-phase">The Brainstorm Phase</h2>
<p>As soon as we got back to our seats, we couldn’t sit still. This wasn’t just some side thing anymore — it was our event.</p>
<p>We rotated the chairs and formed a tight circle in the lab. That circle, that moment — that was the real beginning.</p>
<p>Ideas started flying:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>technical treasure hunt</em>? Rejected. Too complicated to pull off logistically.</li>
<li>A <em>workshop or class</em>? Nah. Wouldn’t attract enough people.</li>
<li>A <em>quiz</em>? That felt right. We knew it could be fun, flexible, and draw a big crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s how the core format got locked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A two-round quiz — starting with general questions, followed by a round that blends general and technical trivia.</p></blockquote>
<p>We wanted it to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast and fun</li>
<li>Not too brain-draining</li>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Certificate-worthy</li>
</ul>
<p>When we presented it to Arsha Ma’am, she gave a green signal and mentioned a target of *50 teams. That number wasn’t random — it matched the *<em>₹5000 prize pool</em> we planned to offer. She made one thing clear: if we couldn’t reach 50 teams, <em>CSI would cover the prize fund</em>. But if we did reach the target, we’d be completely self-sustaining — maybe even make a little surplus for ourselves.</p>
<p>The goal was set. The mission had begun.</p>
<h2 id="designing-the-event">Designing the Event</h2>
<p>We first called it <em>Trivia 2025</em>. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>But through <em>Arsha Ma’am</em>, we got connected to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jace-joji-404972301/"><strong>Jace Joji</strong></a>, our senior, who’s part of the <strong>DataVoid</strong> team. Jace had collaborated with Arsha Ma’am during the previous TechFest and was familiar with hosting quizzes on their platform. He helped us clear our doubts, set things up, and offered to provide an extra certificate for participants from the DataVoid side.</p>
<p>So the event name evolved into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DataVoid Trivia 2025</em></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="our-marketing-strategy-who-how-and-why">Our Marketing Strategy: Who, How, and Why</h2>
<p>After designing the event, our next step was to plan the marketing — and we took this seriously.</p>
<p>We analyzed each year group:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4th years:</strong> Too busy with projects, internships. Might skip Tech Fest. Not ideal.</li>
<li><strong>3rd years:</strong> Most were coordinators themselves. Schedule clash.</li>
<li><strong>2nd years:</strong> Might join. Some interest, depending on how we pitch.</li>
<li><strong>1st years:</strong> Perfect. It’s their first Tech Fest. They’re curious, eager, and hungry for certificates. This was our golden audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>We crafted a full-blown ground-level marketing strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Team Formation:</strong> We had a campaign crew of around 10 members, but typically 6–7 of them were actively canvassing through classes.</li>
<li><strong>Classroom Invasion:</strong> Instead of just dropping links or collecting names like most teams did, we entered classes and pitched properly.</li>
<li><strong>Bench-by-Bench Talk:</strong> Each active member took a bench — explained the event, clarified doubts, encouraged participation.</li>
<li><strong>On-the-Spot Registrations:</strong> If anyone showed interest, we ensured they registered then and there. No second thoughts, no chance for them to delay and forget.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Ups:</strong> For those unsure, we noted their names and followed up later.</li>
</ol>
<p>This <strong>personal, hands-on, and persistent</strong> approach worked — especially with the 1st years. By registering them in class itself, our conversion rate shot up compared to teams who just collected names for “later.”</p>

<p><strong>This simple, clear offer helped us win over participants on the spot.</strong></p>
<h2 id="promotion-troubles-at-first">Promotion Troubles at First</h2>
<p>Our posters, Google Forms, and QR codes were all ready by the weekend before Tech Fest. We shared them everywhere — class groups, batch groups, Instagram stories.</p>
<p>But… nothing. Not a single registration.</p>
<p>We weren’t even allowed to start classroom promotions until the week of TechFest — Monday and Tuesday. So the weekend was just dead silent.</p>
<p>We knew we had a solid event, but without visibility, it meant nothing. The pressure started creeping in.</p>
<h2 id="turning-it-around">Turning It Around</h2>
<p>Monday arrived. The first real chance to canvas.</p>
<p>But — curveball — I had to attend my cousin’s wedding. Aabel was also unavailable. The rest of the team, though, stepped up and went full force into classes.</p>
<p>While at the church for the Holy Mass, I opened my phone post-prayer and saw the first ₹100 GPay notification.</p>
<p>Our first registration. I smiled.</p>
<p>Soon, another came in. Then another. My phone was buzzing. It was finally happening. By the end of the day, 21 teams had registered. ₹2100 collected. We finally had traction. We weren’t going down after all.</p>
<p>Tuesday followed with another surge. Our classroom invasion tactic was paying off.</p>
<h2 id="registration-timeline">Registration Timeline</h2>
<p>Here’s how it panned out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10/02/2025:</strong> 21 teams</li>
<li><strong>11/02/2025:</strong> 45 teams</li>
<li><strong>12/02/2025:</strong> 7 teams</li>
<li><strong>13/02/2025:</strong> 14 teams (includes spot registrations)</li>
</ul>
<p>We had to book an extra classroom (Room 222) to accommodate the overflow.</p>
<p><strong>Final count:</strong> 87 teams — that’s 174 students.</p>
<p>Our tiny quiz dream turned into a big event. The pride we felt? <em>Unmatched.</em></p>
<h2 id="event-day-the-madness">Event Day: The Madness</h2>
<p>13th Feb 2025. The day was here. We assembled early in front of CCC. Mathew Biji handled the juice refreshment. Jace arrived with full support. He and Aabel helped set up the platform, handle the quiz Excel sheets, and manage GPay reconciliations.</p>
<p>We arranged:</p>
<ul>
<li>A spot registration and query desk outside CCC — handled by Elba and Ann Sunny</li>
<li>Inside CCC: 2 participants per PC</li>
<li>In Room C-222: Mobile-based quiz access (for overflow crowd)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was inside, cross-checking registrations, verifying GPay entries, and preparing the live attendance sheet — tracking both spot and pre-registrations.</p>
<p>By 9:30 AM, we planned to close registrations. But they just kept coming. We stretched it till 9:45, then finally called it. When we opened the CCC door — madness. A full-on crowd. Congested like crazy.</p>
<p>Our plan of checking everyone in right there? Cancelled. Instead, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guided batches to either CCC or Room 222</li>
<li>Took attendance live</li>
<li>In the classroom: Elwin announced the program rules</li>
<li>Students logged into the portal from their mobiles</li>
<li>Me, along with Elvi, Arjun, Jen, Elwin, Anne, and Jeon, watched the students as they answered</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside CCC: Ebin, Aabel, Shaji, Elba, Ann Sunny, Elsa, and others monitored students and ensured smooth flow.</p>
<p>Round 1 began around 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Students faced a bug where an image overlapped a question. We called Jace — he said to skip it. By 10:50, the round ended. Top 15 teams shortlisted We handed out juice refreshments.</p>
<h2 id="round-2--final-winners">Round 2 &amp; Final Winners</h2>
<p>Around 11:30 AM, teams reassembled at CCC for Round 2.</p>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rechecked the system</li>
<li>Let students log in again</li>
<li>Stroll around the participants ensuring everyone was on track</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 2 wrapped up in 30 minutes. Results were out. The Top 3 were chosen and awarded their prizes by our Assistant HoD, Andrews Sir.</p>
<p>We clicked group pics with Arsha Ma’am and Andrews Sir — she was visibly happy. Proud. Then we cleaned up, arranged the chairs, and tossed out juice packs. Left the place just as we found it.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>At the beginning itself, Arsha Ma’am had told us that anything we made beyond the prize pool was ours to keep.</p>
<p>And yes, we did make a small surplus. To our surprise, Ma’am also handed us some extra money, and with that, our lunch for both TechFest and ArtFest days got covered.</p>
<p>We later came to know — out of the dozens of events that ran during the TechFest, DataVoid Trivia had the highest number of registrations.</p>
<h2 id="looking-back">Looking Back</h2>
<p>Honestly, this was a massive milestone for me. Not because it was “just” an event, but because it was our event. Built from scratch, coordinated by friends, and executed without chaos.</p>
<p>We’re a group of thick friends — we don’t do half-hearted. From flipping chairs in a lab to chasing students with QR codes, we poured our heart into this. And the reward?</p>
<p>Pride. Growth. Memories.</p>
<p>DataVoid Trivia 2025 — we’ll remember this one for a long, long time.</p>
